# sass-only-gulp
Basic Gulp setup that just compiles, auto-prefixes, and minifies Sass files.

## Run

npm install

gulp watch

to watch Sass files and compile on save.

## Also

This is meant as a base setup for using Sass with a CMS, where the templates and javascript files could be setup any number of ways.
I've also got some Normalize from https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/,
many utilities from Foundation for Sites https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites,
and a lot of my own stuff.
